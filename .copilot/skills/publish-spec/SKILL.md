# Publish Spec Skill

Build the AI Catalog & Trust Manifest specification from Markdown source and
publish it as a static website via GitHub Pages.

## Source Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `specification/ai-catalog.md` | Markdown source of truth |
| `specification/respec-config.json` | ReSpec configuration (title, abstract, appendix headers) |
| `dist/index.html` | Generated site artifact |
| `.github/workflows/publish-spec.yml` | GitHub Pages build and deploy workflow |

## Build Pipeline

### Step 1: Generate the site locally

```bash
uv run --locked python tools/build_spec.py specification/ai-catalog.md dist/index.html --config specification/respec-config.json
```

This converts the Markdown into the generated HTML site at `dist/index.html`
using the repo's `uv`-managed dependencies.

### Step 2: Publish via GitHub Pages

Push changes to the `main` branch to trigger
`.github/workflows/publish-spec.yml`, which rebuilds the canonical site and
updates the `gh-pages` branch served at `https://agent-card.github.io/ai-card/`.
Same-repo pull requests also publish rendered preview pages under
`https://agent-card.github.io/ai-card/pr/<number>/`.

## One-Liner (Build + Deploy)

```bash
uv run --locked python tools/build_spec.py specification/ai-catalog.md dist/index.html --config specification/respec-config.json
```

## Prerequisites

- `uv`
- Python 3.12+
- GitHub Pages configured to serve from the `gh-pages` branch root
- Push or merge access to `main` for canonical site publication
